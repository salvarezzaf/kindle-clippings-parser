squared is a measurement of how much of a fund’s performance can be attributed to the performance of an index. It can range from 0.00 to 1.00. An R squared of 1.00 indicates perfect correlation: When a fund goes up, it’s because the index was up — every time; when the fund falls, it’s because the index fell — every time. An R squared of 0.00 indicates no such correlation. This measurement is used to assess tracking errors and to identify closet index funds.

Some research shows that perhaps 90 to 95 percent of a mutual fund’s or ETF’s performance may be attributable to its asset class alone. In other words, any large cap growth fund will tend to perform similarly to other large cap growth funds. Any small cap value fund will tend to perform similarly to other small cap value funds.

Interest rates often (not always, but often) drop during tough economic times. Interest rates and bond prices have an inverse relationship. When interest rates fall, already-issued bonds (carrying older, relatively high coupon rates) shoot up in price.

Investment legend Benjamin Graham liked to use something called the P/E ratio. The P stands for price; the E stands for earnings. When the market price of a stock (or all stocks) is high, and the earnings (or profits for a company or companies) are low, then you have a high P/E ratio; conversely, when the market price is down but earnings are up, you have a low P/E ratio. Graham, as well as his student Warren Buffett, preferred to buy when the P/E ratio was low.
